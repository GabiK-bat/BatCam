# Overview

**BatCam** is an open-source, low-cost, do-it-yourself infrared video camera built with off-the-shelf components. It was designed for automated monitoring of bat activity and behavior at hibernation and roosting sites equipped with infrared light barriers and camera traps. However, it can be easily adapted to a wide variety of field applications, with particular focus on nocturnal animals. Custom recording schedules can be set by the user and the direct connection to the infrared light barrier allows us to convert the continuous video recordings into short clips of each bat passing through the light barrier. Additionally, any other sensors with analog output can serve as a trigger signal for clipping the full-night video recordings. 

We provide a step-by-step instruction to build, configure and use the camera in the field, along with Python codes for video post-processing, making it accessible to anyone with minimal technical and programming skills.

## Configuration


## Video processing
### Converting h264 video format into mp4
```python
import glob
from subprocess import call
from time import sleep

source_path = "xxx" #set path of folder with raw video files (h264)
target_path = "xxx" #set path of folder to save converted video files (mp4)

videos = glob.glob(source_path + "*.h264")
counter = 1
print(videos)
for video in videos:
	base_name = video.split("/")[-1][0:-5]
	print(f"Converting {base_name} ({counter}/{len(videos)})")
	counter += 1
	source_name = source_path + base_name + ".h264"
	target_name = target_path + base_name + ".mp4"
	call(f"MP4Box -add '{source_name}' '{target_name}'",shell = True)
	print("\t-> conversion complete!")
	sleep(1)
```

### Creating 6-second-long video snips based on light barrier registrations
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import glob
from moviepy.video.io.ffmpeg_tools import ffmpeg_extract_subclip

det_path = "xxx" #set path of "Detections.txt" file containing the light barrier registrations
vid_path = "xxx" #set path of folder with converted video files
snip_path = "xxx" #setpath of folder to save snips

# load light barrier registrations
det = pd.read_table(det_path,sep=":| ",engine="python",header=None,names=["direction","date","hour",
"min","sec"])
det["sec_mid"] = [row[2] * 3600 + row[3] * 60 + row[4] for index, row in det.iterrows()]
print("Detections loaded!")

# load converted video data	
vid = pd.DataFrame({"path":[],"file":[],"date":[],"hour":[],"min":[],"sec":[],"sec_mid":[]})
videos = glob.glob(vid_path + "*.mp4")
for video in videos:
	file_name = video.split("/")[-1][0:-4]
	print(file_name)
	date = file_name[7:17].split("_")
	date_re = str(date[2] + "." + date[1] + "." + date[0])
	time = file_name[18:26].split("_")
	sec_mid = int(time[0]) * 3600 + int(time[1]) * 60 + int(time[2])
	vid = vid.append({"path":video,"file":file_name,"date":date_re,"hour":time[0],
	"min":time[1],"sec":time[2],"sec_mid":sec_mid},ignore_index=True)
vid["sec_mid"] = vid["sec_mid"].astype(int)
print("Video information loaded!")
fails = 0

# loop over light barrier detections and find matching (15 minute long) video file 
print("Matching detections with video files")
for index, row in det.iterrows():
	fail = False
	print(f"  -> searching for detection at {row['hour']}:{row['min']}:{row['sec']} 
	on the {row['date']}")
	target_vid = vid[(vid["date"] == row["date"]) & (vid["sec_mid"] <= row["sec_mid"]) 
	& (vid["sec_mid"] >= row["sec_mid"]-15*60)]
	print(f"     -> video found: {target_vid['file'].to_string().split()[1]}")
	print("          -> extracting video snip...")
	print(target_vid["sec_mid"].values)
	vid_secmid = (target_vid["sec_mid"].values).tolist()
	target_file = (target_vid["file"].values).tolist()
	print(target_file)
	try:	
		print(vid_secmid[0])
		#3 second before light barrier registration = start of snip
		t1 = row["sec_mid"] - vid_secmid[0] - 3 
		#3 second after light barrier registration = end of snip
		t2 = row["sec_mid"] - vid_secmid[0] + 3 
		print(f"{t1} - {t2}")
		print(target_file[0] + ".mp4")
		target_file = target_file[0] + ".mp4"
	except:
		print("Empty Array")
	snip_date = "_".join(reversed(row["date"].split(".")))
	snip_name = "snip_"+snip_date+"_"+str(row["hour"]).zfill(2)+"_"+str(row["min"]).zfill(2)
	+"_"+str(row["sec"]).zfill(2)+"_"+row["direction"]+".mp4"
	
	#extract 6-second-long snip from video file
	try:		
		ffmpeg_extract_subclip(vid_path+target_file,int(t1),int(t2),snip_path+snip_name)
	# most common cause of failure are detections outside of recording time 
	# no video for extraction
	except:
		fail = True	
		fails += 1
	
	if fail:
		print("          -> extraction FAILED!")
	else:
		print("          -> extraction complete!")
	
print(f"Conversion completed ({fails} detections could not be found)")
```
