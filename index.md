# Overview

BatCam is an open-source, low-cost, do-it-yourself infrared video camera built with off-the-shelf components and was designed for automated monitoring of bat activity and behavior at hibernation and roosting sites equipped with infrared light barriers. However, it is easily adaptable for use in a wide variety of field applications, with particular focus on nocturnal animals. Custom recording schedules can be set by the user and the direct connection to the infrared light barrier allows us to convert the continuous video recordings into short clips of each bat passing through the light barrier. Additionally, any other sensors with analog output can serve as a trigger signal for clipping the full-night video recording. We provide a step-by-step instruction to build, configure and use the camera in the field, along with Python codes for video post-processing, making it accessible to anyone with minimal technical and programming skills.
