# Overview

BatCam is an open-source, low-cost, do-it-yourself infrared video camera based on the Raspberry Pi computer, aimed to continuously record animal activity. It is designed for automated monitoring of bat activity and behavior at hibernation and roosting sites, but it is easily adaptable for use in a wide variety of field study contexts, with particular focus on nocturnal animals. The camera can have scheduled recording time and an additional connection to an infrared light barrier, or any other sensors with analog output, allow to convert the continuous recordings into short video snips of each bat passing through the light barrier. 

We provide step-by-step instructions to build, configure and use the camera in the field, along with codes for video post-processing, making it accessible to anyone with minimal technical and programming skills.
