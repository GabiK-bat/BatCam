Instructions regarding the construction and configuration of an open-source, low-cost infrared video camera that was designed for automated monitoring of bat activity and behavior can be found here https://gabik-bat.github.io/FlederCam/. Using this technical guide, along with the source codes for video post-processing, the system can be easily adapted to a wide variety of field applications, with particular focus on nocturnal animals.
